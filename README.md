# About Me
I am a first year student at [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu/) studying software engineering. I am interested in human computer interaction, cyber security, and machine learning. I have previously worked at Draper Labs in Cambridge, MA.

This is where I put the most up to date information about my software projects, but you can also check out my [Resume](#) and [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-mcdermott-264812124/)

# Projects

### Gene Finder 
#### [Source Code](https://github.com/vickymmcd/GeneFinder)
I wrote a script that takes long sequences of DNA as strings and returns the amino acid sequences which are most likely encoded by that DNA.

### Computational Art
#### [Source Code](https://github.com/vickymmcd/ComputationalArt)
I created a program that generates a random art based on recursive computation of elementary functions.

### Text Mining
#### [Source Code](https://github.com/vickymmcd/TextMining)
I created a program that extracts the 200 tweets published by the accounts of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump prior to the November 8, 2016 election. I then compiled a list of the most commonly used words by each candidate to determine which words were more effective in convincing the electorate to vote. I also used the sentiment analyzer to determine which candidate used more positive, negative, and neutral language in their tweets.

### Interactive Visualization
#### [Source Code](https://github.com/vickymmcd/InteractiveProgramming), [Project Website](https://vickymmcd.github.io/InteractiveProgramming/)
Working with 1 other student, I created a program that predicts where someone is from and what their age is based on their responses to a survey. The predictions are updated after every question is answered. We visually depict these predictions using a map of the US and an age line. We used Bayesian statistics and two datasets (one about grammar and one about earthquakes) as background information to make our predictions.
